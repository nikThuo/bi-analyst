    "## Part A: Report Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "1. **Student Performance by Course**: For each student, list their courses, the grade they received for each course in the latest module, and the average grade for each student across all their courses in the most recent module.\n",
    "2. **Student Information**: Include the studentâ€™s first name, last name, and grade level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we process the following:\n",
    "1. Filter data to include only grades from the most recent module.\n",
    "2. Calculate the average grade for each student.\n",
    "3. Combine student details with performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Tables Used:\n",
    "- **Students**: Basic student information (e.g., `student_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `grade_level`).\n",
    "- **Grades**: Performance metrics, filtered by the latest module.\n",
    "- **Courses**: Course information.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Loading Data into Power BI\n",
    "1. **Extract Data**:\n",
    "    - Export tables (`Students`, `Courses`, `Enrollments`, `Grades`) as CSV files or connect directly to the database.\n",
    "2. **Load Data**:\n",
    "    - Open Power BI Desktop and use the \"Get Data\" option to import the CSV files or connect to the database.\n",
    "3. **Transform Data**:\n",
    "    - Use Power Query Editor to clean, format, and merge the data.\n",
    "4. **Define Relationships**:\n",
    "    - Ensure relationships like `student_id` and `course_id` are properly established between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Visualizations\n",
    "1. **Student Grades by Course**:\n",
    "    - A table visualization with:\n",
    "        - Columns: Student Name, Course Name, Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Grades by Grade Level**:\n",
    "    - A bar chart showing:\n",
    "        - X-axis: Grade Level\n",
    "        - Y-axis: Average Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing Power BI for Large Datasets\n",
    "1. **Data Reduction**:\n",
    "    - Remove unnecessary columns and rows before loading.\n",
    "2. **Data Aggregation**:\n",
    "    - Pre-aggregate data where possible.\n",
    "3. **Efficient Relationships**:\n",
    "    - Use a star schema for simplicity and performance.\n",
    "4. **Incremental Refresh**:\n",
    "    - Enable incremental data refresh for large datasets.\n",
